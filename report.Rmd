## Executive Summary
### What is this report about?
Our purpose is to **determine whether the acquisition of ElectroIndex is convenient for Blackwell Electronics**. To do so, we want to understand the overlapping or lack thereof of customer and products base for both companies.

Furthermore, we want to understand the possible associations between products based on the analysis of past purchase baskets of ElectroIndex, in order to uncover possible sinergies between the two companies.

### Methodology
Build rules association rules

### Conclusions
<!-- We know that Blackwell is like MediaMarket and ElectroIndex is like a store in carrer Sepulveda. They cater to different people as it seems, the former to general consumers while the latter goes for electronics enthusiasts.-->
